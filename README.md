Coursera Course Project - Getting and Cleaning Data
====================================================
The course project consists of following five (5) steps, theyare:
  1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
  3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
  5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
The interpretation of these steps is dictated by the person generating the results.

The end result is to produce 2 types of files.  The first file is the merging of several data files, to produce a "grid-like" representation of the data, with only the mean() and std() values. The second file is to produce "tidy data" from the first file by creating an average of all of the observations for the mean() and std().

The end resulting data created for this project (from step 5) is a wide tidt data set, showing the X, Y, and Z  mean and standard deviation average values collected from the original experiment.

This project consists of the following files:

Origins for the project
====================================================
The data for this effort, and information about the experiment comes from the following location:
"https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip"
This zip file must be downloaded, and unzipped.

The original data comes from an experiment called: "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphone Dataset"
For more details on the experiment and the original dataset, pleasse read the "README.txt" and "features_info.txt" files located in the forementioned zip file.
