# Code book for Getting and Cleaning data - Course Project
This codebook is to discribe the steps being taken to complete the "Getting and Cleaning data" course
A little information about the data
This project will be working with the data sets from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
Version 1.0"

The prerequisit is as follows:
"You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following"
You will find the R script in the same directory in which you found this codebook.

The first step of the process was to download the data locally.  This allowed me to be able to work on this effort while not neededing to be connected to the Internet.

The first requested is:
"Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set"
Within the zip file there will be two folders labeled "train" and "test". In each folder (respectively) there are files labeled, "X_train.txt", "y_train.txt" (in the "train" folder), and"X_test.txt", "y_test.txt" (in the "test" folder)
